import turtle: This line imports the Turtle graphics library, which allows you to create drawings and designs using a turtle-shaped cursor on the screen.
t = turtle.Turtle(): This line creates a Turtle object named t that we'll use to draw our design.
s = turtle.Screen(): This line creates a Screen object named s. The screen is the canvas on which we'll draw our design.
s.bgcolor('black'): Sets the background color of the screen to black, creating a black canvas for our design.
t.width(3): Sets the pen width to 3 pixels. This determines the thickness of the lines drawn by the turtle.
t.speed(25): Sets the drawing speed of the turtle. The speed of 25 means that the turtle will draw relatively quickly.
col = ('orange', 'white', 'green'): Defines a tuple named col that contains three colors: magenta, yellow, and green. These colors will be used for the lines in the design.
for i in range(500):: Initiates a loop that will run 500 times to draw the design.
t.pencolor(col[i % 3]): Sets the pen color based on the current iteration. The % 3 ensures that the colors in the col tuple are used in a cyclic manner as the loop iterates.
t.forward(i * 4): Moves the turtle forward by a distance that increases with each iteration (i * 4). This creates the effect of lines getting longer as the turtle progresses.
t.right(121): Turns the turtle to the right by 121 degrees after drawing each line. This angle choice results in the interesting pattern.
Finally, s.exitonclick(): This line ensures that the turtle graphics window will remain open until you click on it. Once you click the window, it will close.
